# SE-1106: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming

## Overview
This repository contains the in-class live coding examples from the **SE-1106: Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming** course. The code is designed to provide students with hands-on experience and deepen their understanding of core object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java.

## Topics Covered
The project includes instructive examples on the following OOP topics:

- **Classes and Objects**
- **Members (Fields and Methods)**
- **Special Methods of Classes**:
  - **Constructors**
  - **toString()**
  - **equals()**
  - **Getters and Setters**
- **Inheritance**
- **Abstract Classes**
- **Interfaces**
- **Container Classes**
- **Exceptions**
- **Polymorphism**
- **Encapsulation**

## Code Organization
The code is organized by lecture weeks to facilitate navigation and comprehension:

- Each week's code is stored in a package named `weekX`, where `X` corresponds to the lecture week.
- Examples in each package demonstrate the concepts introduced during that week's lecture.

## Features
- **Step-by-Step Learning**: Code written live during lectures to enhance understanding.
- **Practical Examples**: Real-world inspired examples to highlight OOP principles.
- **Modular Design**: Well-structured packages for ease of access and learning.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ozdindar/SE1106LectureProject.git
   ```
2. Import the project into your favorite Java IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse).
3. Navigate to the desired `weekX` package to explore specific topics.

## Requirements
- Java 8 or higher

## Usage
This repository is intended for:
- Students who want to review lecture examples and practice OOP concepts.
- Instructors looking for a structured repository of OOP teaching material.
